## Alpha Quality Features

Alpha-quality features are features which are currently in development, and are not considered part of the core SDK functionality. 

When using alpha features, you may experience missing functionality, crashes, or instability. Functionality may be added, removed or changed without warning between minor or patch releases. These changes may be made in a manner which is contrary to the SDK's semantic version number.

You should not depend on alpha features for any high-value or important projects. Whilst we will aim to support people and projects using these features, some issues encountered may be more challenging or time-consuming to fix.

Please post any feedback or issues in the [Developer Forums](https://developer.litho.cc/c/sdk-general).
