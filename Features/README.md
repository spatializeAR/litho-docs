## SDK Features
|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**Laser Pointer** ![Laser Pointer](../Images/Features/Laser.png)](../Manual/UnityScripting.md#pointer) | Litho hands you an accurate laser pointer that you can use to select and manipulate objects in AR. The flexible laser can also convey virtual forces such as weight, drag and pull. |
|  |  |
| [**Object Manipulation** ![Object Manipulation](../Images/Features/Manipulate.png)](../Manual/UnityScripting.md#basic-interaction-components) | Move and rotate objects in space with precision using the two different grips LITHO currently supports: Point and Clutch. |
|  |  |
| **Touchpad** [![Touch pad](../Images/Features/TouchInput.png)](#) | A custom capacitive touchpad capable of sub-millimeter precision. It can sense in 2 dimensions - providing you with accurate (x,y) coordinates whether it's a tap or a swipe. |
|  |  |
| **Clean UI** [![Clean UI](../Images/Features/CleanUI.png)](#) | The Unity SDK comes with a clean UI system to use and modify in projects. The UI lets you easily connect a Litho device to your phone, and takes you through the Litho onboarding process. |
|  |  |
| **Spatial Menu** [![Spatial Menu](../Images/Features/SpatialUI2.png)](#) | The SDK comes with a couple of nifty tools for you to hold objects in place and keep them organized. Duplicating, removing and positioning objects is made easy thanks to virtual fixtures that help guide your AR experience. |
|  |  |
| [**Litho Emulator** ![Litho Emulator](../Images/Features/Emulator.png)](LithoEmulator.md) | You can now develop for Litho without connecting a device. The emulator lets you quickly test your designs in the Unity editor using your mouse and keyboard. This saves time and creates the possibility to develop with Litho without the need for an actual device.|
