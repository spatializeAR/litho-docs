## Litho Emulator

This component allows you to emulate Litho and camera movement conveniently in the Unity Editor. Click on the Unity Editor Game view using your computer mouse to activate it - note that you must have a _GameViewController_ component attached to the _Litho_ object in the current open scene for this to work.

Feel free to delete the GameViewController component if you do not find these emulator features helpful. 

#### Controls:

Click on the Unity Editor Game view using your computer mouse to activate the emulator, then, in the Game view, whilst in Play mode:

|Input  | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Point**| to aim at an object using Litho|
| **Left-click**| to simulate Litho touchpad 'tap' events|
| **Left-click + hold**| to simulate Litho touchpad 'hold' and 'long hold' events|
| **Left-click + _W_, _A_, _S_, _D_ keys**| to move touch position (when in Clutch grip, this allows depth manipulation)|
| **Left-click + scroll wheel**| to twist Litho (when in Point grip, this allows depth manipulation)|
| **Right-click + drag**| to rotate camera|
| **Right-click + _W_, _A_, _S_, _D_ keys**| to move camera|
| **_L_ key**| lock (or unlock) the state of the emulator - use this to hold objects whilst interacting with other Unity views|
